The Speech to Text project is a web application that allows users to convert spoken words into written text. Users can enter text in the provided input box or use the microphone button to speak their words, which will then be converted to audio.

Here's how the project works:

1. User Interface: The project has a simple user interface with an input box and a button. The input box is where users can type or speak their words, and the button triggers the conversion of text to audio.

2. Text Input: Users can manually type their desired text into the input box. As they type, the text value is stored in the component's state using the `useState` hook from React.

3. Speech Recognition: The project utilizes the Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesisUtterance to convert the entered text into audio. When the user clicks the button, a new SpeechSynthesisUtterance instance is created, and the text value from the input box is passed as the parameter. The speech synthesis functionality is provided by the `window.speechSynthesis` object.

4. Audio Output: The created SpeechSynthesisUtterance instance is then passed to the `speak` method of the `window.speechSynthesis` object, triggering the conversion of the text to audio. The audio output is played through the user's device speakers.

5. Styling: The project utilizes styled components, a popular styling library in React, to apply styles to the various components in the application. The components are styled using CSS properties such as padding, margin, border, background color, etc. Additionally, media queries are used to create responsive styles that adapt to different screen sizes.

The Speech to Text project provides a convenient way for users to convert their spoken words into written text. It leverages the Web Speech API and styled components to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Users can use the input box to enter text manually or click the microphone button to speak their words and generate corresponding audio output.
